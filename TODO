	Woah, there is some -serious- rounding error on the sample
data ... what is a CPU sample !? ...
	We need to upgrade the samples to 'ns' underneath, currently
we only see a ms at a time - which sucks [!] lets up-res the
old-style / bog-standard samples.


Account for the time taken to run the bootchart-collector ...
	+ scale all other times by this ammount [!] ;-)
	+ to make it -appear- as if it doesn't impact the system :-)

* render I/O data backwards ... :-)
	+ what steps in this data do we get ?

* Add a cumulative graph view:
	+ showing who used how much CPU over what time ...
		+ pretty colors [etc.]

* include the "exit conditions" into the source code (?)
	+ compiled in ? or on the command-line ?
	+ -- <exit procs> ...

Test with an initrd

FIXME:
	+ make the 'extents' thing work [!]
	+ if we have a short chart, it should be less wide.

Graph the swap / I/O delay stuff inside the bar (?)



Scale time discontinuously ? [ make the first seconds much longer ? ]

Remove 'merge_logger' - no longer necessary - it's just one app ...
	+ potentially we should hide / remove it though :-)

* Merged from elsewhere:
	+ why process the data in python ? can't we do it earlier ?
		+ adjust the previous sample etc.
	+ helps to have the raw data - but we can do much better [!]

Process taskstats in advance
	+ elide all non-useful lines:
		+ ie. no-changes in various fields
