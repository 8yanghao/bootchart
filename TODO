* Push me to github ...

* render I/O data backwards ... :-)
	+ what steps in this data do we get ?

* include the "exit conditions" into the source code (?)
	+ compiled in ? or on the command-line ?
	+ -- <exit procs> ...

Ensure the kernel goodness gets charted too (!?)

pacct
	+ deals with short lived processes that fork others
		+ gets parenting correct ... [!] 
		+ logs -all- processes, not just some (?)

	* Just parse & read the binary Pacct files ...
		+ should be good enough; for short lived foo ...

Test with an initrd

FIXME:
	+ make the 'extents' thing work [!]
	+ if we have a short chart, it should be less wide.

Make pybootchartgui input default to /var/log/bootchart.tgz ...

Make pybootchartgui use pacct output [!]

Graph the swap / I/O delay stuff inside the bar (?)


Account for the time taken to run the bootchart-collector ...
	+ scale all other times by this ammount [!] ;-)
	+ to make it -appear- as if it doesn't impact the system :-)

Scale time discontinuously ? [ make the first seconds much longer ? ]

Incorporate Arjan's kernel boot time introspection pieces ?

Remove 'merge_logger' - no longer necessary - it's just one app ...
	+ potentially we should hide / remove it though :-)

* Merged from elsewhere:

	+ why process the data in python ? can't we do it earlier ?
		+ adjust the previous sample etc.
	+ helps to have the raw data - but we can do much better [!]

Process taskstats in advance
	+ elide all non-useful lines:
		+ ie. no-changes in various fields
