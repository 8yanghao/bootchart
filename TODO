** Bugs:

	+ horizontal zoom - should keep view horiz centered:
	  but does not - cf. set_xscale

	+ merge processes for CPU counts:
		+ if the ns count is -identical- (and non-zero) it is the same process
			+ need to back-merge somehow ?
				:-)
			+ or can we do this by pid ? [ prolly ! ]

	+ fix for profiling a running system ... [ get the origin right ! ]

	+ the renderer - should not show the kernel etc.
		- if it is > 5 mins from start etc.

	* actually use the 'xscale' factor in draw.render [etc.]
		+ to get horizontal zoom

** Features:

* Use ptrace to extract the trace data from the daemon (cf. git branch)
* Do taskstat based pid polling before /proc is mounted [ to capture that ]
* Look for a taskstat interface to enumerate processes & pids ...
* Use the netlink interface to follow forks accurately


Account for the time taken to run the bootchart-collector ...
	+ scale all other times by this ammount [!] ;-)
	+ to make it -appear- as if it doesn't impact the system :-)

* render I/O data backwards ... :-)
	+ what steps in this data do we get ?

* Add a cumulative graph view:
	+ showing who used how much CPU over what time ...
		+ pretty colors [etc.]

* include the "exit conditions" into the source code (?)
	+ compiled in ? or on the command-line ?
	+ -- <exit procs> ...

Test with an initrd

FIXME:
	+ make the 'extents' thing work [!]
	+ if we have a short chart, it should be less wide.

Graph the swap / I/O delay stuff inside the bar (?)



Scale time discontinuously ? [ make the first seconds much longer ? ]

Remove 'merge_logger' - no longer necessary - it's just one app ...
	+ potentially we should hide / remove it though :-)

* Merged from elsewhere:
	+ why process the data in python ? can't we do it earlier ?
		+ adjust the previous sample etc.
	+ helps to have the raw data - but we can do much better [!]

Process taskstats in advance
	+ elide all non-useful lines:
		+ ie. no-changes in various fields

* Export ODF, with a number of pie charts in it etc.
	+ export cumulative data for rendering in ods ?
	+ rather than adding manual rendering - which sucks (!?)
